# Jeff's Git Sockcamp

Experiments and lessons-learned with git.

## First off: git push "un-do"

Problem statement: Ugh! My colleague just told me that a push I did a couple of weeks ago had junk in it that doesn't belong in our repo. I need to pull back that push without disturbing the rest of our repo.

### The Plan

To simulate this scenario, I'll create three text files and push them to the remote repository.

After the third `git push`, I'll claw back that second push.
